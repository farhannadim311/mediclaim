# ZK Claim Verifier - Judges Summary

## 🏆 Hackathon MVP Overview

**Project**: ZK Claim Verifier  
**Team**: Midnight Network Hackathon  
**Timeline**: 48-hour MVP  
**Focus**: Privacy-preserving insurance claim verification using zero-knowledge proofs

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Challenge**: How can insurers verify insurance claims without learning the claimant's private data (PHI/PII)?

**Solution**: A zero-knowledge proof system that validates claims while only revealing minimal metadata needed for processing.

## 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Verification

- Claims are verified without revealing sensitive data
- Only verification status and minimal metadata are disclosed
- Patient data, amounts, and descriptions remain opaque
- Provider signatures ensure authenticity

### Business Rule Enforcement

- Amount limits per claim type
- Date range validation
- Provider authorization checks
- Patient eligibility verification

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract (Compact)

```compact
// Main verification circuit
export circuit verifyClaim(
  claim: Claim,
  providerPubX: Bytes<32>,
  providerPubY: Bytes<32>,
  signatureR8x: Bytes<32>,
  signatureR8y: Bytes<32>,
  signatureS: Bytes<32>,
  currentTimestamp: Uint<32>
): Uint<64>
```

### ZK Witnesses

- `VERIFY_CLAIM_SIGNATURE` - EdDSA signature verification
- `VERIFY_CLAIM_AMOUNT` - Business rule validation
- `VERIFY_SERVICE_DATE` - Date range checks
- `VERIFY_PROVIDER_AUTHORIZATION` - Role-based access
- `VERIFY_PATIENT_ELIGIBILITY` - Coverage verification

### API Layer

- RESTful endpoints for claim submission
- ZK proof verification logic
- Midnight Network integration
- Comprehensive error handling

### React Frontend

- Interactive claim submission form
- Real-time verification results
- Sample data generation
- Privacy indicators
